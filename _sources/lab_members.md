Max Hinne is an assistant professor at the Donders Institute. His research focuses on understanding and predicting the behaviour of complex dynamic systems. Doing this in a nuanced, interpretable, and efficient way requires a probabilistic perspective, which plays a central role in his work. Max combines both the development of state-of-the-art analyses and their applications in domains such as network neuroscience and healthcare.
