# Bamojax

[Bamojax](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15038847) is the Bayesian modelling in JAX toolkit developed by our group. It provides an interface between Bayesian computational modelling and fast inference using the [Blackjax](https://blackjax-devs.github.io/blackjax/) software. 

More tutorials on **bamojax** will follow here later. For now, feel free to browse the examples at https://github.com/UncertaintyInComplexSystems/bamojax.
